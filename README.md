# LemonMail DApp

Although there are already products that offer secure and private email services (such as ProtonMail), all of them still have to rely on some kind of central server which essentially becomes a single point of failure. After following emerging distributed technologies such as Ethereum and IPFS for some time, we have realised that it has become possible to create a messaging service that is both secure and completely decentralized. LemonMail DApp is a first attempt at creating such service.
Security

Like with other secure emails services, all message content is end-to-end encrypted before it leaves your browser and therefore can only be viewed by you and your correspondent. Encryption is achieved using public key cryptography, where a new private key is generated by signing a predefined message using your Ethereum account. This new private key never leaves your browser, but it's public counterpart gets broadcast on the Ethereum blockchain, so that others can encrypt messages before sending them to you. The DApp does not have direct access to your Ethereum private key. Encryption is done using bitcore-lib and bitcore-ecies libraries.
External gateways

The DApp is completely decentralized when messages are exchanged between two DApp users. However, you can still send messages to regular email addresses (like GMail), since we are also running a SMTP service that is monitoring blockchain transactions and forwarding emails to the external users. In order for these external emails to remain secure, you will have to come up with a question to which only the receiver will know the answer. He will then have to provide this secret answer in order to decrypt email that was delivered to him. On the other hand, you can also receive emails from external users, but they should be sent to yourusername@dapp.lemon.email instead of your regular lemonmail.eth address. Keep in mind that security for these incoming external emails is not guaranteed, since they will usually go unencrypted through a number of different servers before reaching you.

# Building and deployment

In order to build the application, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run production
cp -r public/web/dist/* publicIpfs
```

Then if you want to publish the application on IPFS, run:

```
ipfs add -r publicIpfs
```

You should receive the following hash: 

```
